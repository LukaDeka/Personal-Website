## Purpose

This is my ever-evolving list of personal milestones: goals I’ve reached, ones I’m working toward, and new ones I’ll continue to add over time. It’s a way to track growth, celebrate progress, and stay motivated along the journey.

I'm keeping my list public to keep myself accountable, and inspire others to start their own list as well.

This page was inspired by **Diogo Torres Correia** and his [Impossible List](https://diogotc.com/impossiblelist/).
