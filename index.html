        <h1>Welcome to Luka's self-hosted website!</h1>
        <span>
          Here I talk about my experiences with tech, as well as present
          my career path, education, projects, and experiences.
          <p>
          Check out my <a href="">blog</a> (work in progress), as well as my <a href="">personal milestones</a> (work in progress), which lists my active and completed goals for the future.

        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <div class="project">
          <h2>EMBArk – Django-UI for Siemens Energy</h2>
          <span>
            Open source university project in cooperation with Siemens Energy: Further development of a Python web UI for managing firmware analyses via SSH workers in a team, with a focus on agile methodologies.
            <p>
            Our student team had multiple weekly meetings in which we discussed the future of the project and prioritized tickets. We also had mandatory reviews for each pull-request which helped uphold a high standard of code-quality.
          </span>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
          <h2>Server administration of network systems with NixOS</h2>
          <span>
            Declarative configuration & administration of fault-tolerant servers with Cloudflare, Mesh VPNs, nginx, ZFS, SSHFS, monitoring, cloud printing, email server, and proxy. With a focus on IT security, reliability, and best practices.
            <p>
            This is currently my main hobby. Started in 2024, now I rely on many of these services. I also run a server for my parents which they use for media storage as well as QoL improvements like cloud-printing. This server is also used as a remote backup.
            <p>
            With this, my journey to degoogle my life and rely less on external services has been a success.

        <div class="project">
          <h2>File archiver in C</h2>
          <span>
            Archives/extracts files in its own format using Huffman coding. Implements multi-stage compression for a minimal file size. Programmed without external dependencies or libraries.
            <p>
            This was done to learn about Huffman coding and different file compression techniques. I also had to come up with my own format to overcome the challenges of storing data in bits instead of bytes (as per the algorithm).

        <h1>Career</h1>
        <div class="career">
          <h2>Junior Backend Engineer Internship – Talkpal Inc.</h2>
          <span>
            Scrum-based backend development with NestJS & microservices: optimization of Redis queues for email scheduling, endpoint conversion in Swagger, debugging with PostgreSQL, etc.
            <p>
            Here I had first-hand experience in how mid to large teams operate. I helped with bugfixes, modularized endpoints, updated the documentation, and optimized Redis queue sizes of mails.
          </span>
        </div>
        <div class="career">
          <h2>Information Technology Support Specialist – Cura Unternehmensgruppe GmbH</h2>
          <span>
            Support with network and user administration, hardware maintenance and management, automation, and documentation in the IT field.
            <p>
            Here I gained invaluable people-skills, as well as further developed my logical reasoning. Problems in IT seem often unexplainable, but the methodology of fixing it is often quite similar.
            <p>
            I also worked on repairing/repurposing decommissioned hardware as well as automating some chores my colleagues had to do e.g. user account creation using a PowerShell script that reorders a CSV, and creates new fields based on hashmaps.
